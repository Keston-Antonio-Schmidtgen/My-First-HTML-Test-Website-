    <p title="I am using tooltip"

     style="color: rgb(202, 120, 27);"> The history of <i>Trinidad and Tobago</i> begins with the settlements of the islands by Indigenous First Peoples. Both islands were visited by <sub>Christopher Columbus</sub> on his third voyage in 1498 and claimed in the name of Spain. <br> Trinidad remained in Spanish hands until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists. Tobago changed hands between the <strong>British, French, Dutch, and Courlanders,</strong>, but eventually ended up in British hands following the second Treaty of Paris (1814). <br> In 1889 the two islands were incorporated into a single crown colony. Trinidad and Tobago obtained its independence from the British Empire in 1962 and became a republic in 1976.

    <p style="color: rgb(192, 43, 24);">The culture of <i>Trinidad and Tobago</i> reflects the influence of <strong>Asian, European, African, Amerindian, American, West Indians and Arab cultures</strong>. The histories of Trinidad and Tobago are different. There are differences in the cultural influences which have shaped each island. <br> Trinidad and Tobago is an English-speaking country with strong links to the United Kingdom.

        Historical membership in the British Empire left a major influence on the country, including the differences of the English language and the popularity of the two top sports in the country, <br> football, and cricket.
